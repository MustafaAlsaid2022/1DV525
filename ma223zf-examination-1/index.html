        <h2>Building a website using HTML and CSS</h2>

        <p>In this assignment I should create a website using HTML5 and CSS. The website contains one "Home" page and three subpages. HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and also to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML 5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML; the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018. </p>
