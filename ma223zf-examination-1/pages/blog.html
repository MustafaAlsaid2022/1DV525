        <h2>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h2>

        <p>It is a file created by a Web site owners and kept in the root of the websites to give instructions about their site to web robots. It tells the robot that it should not visit specific or all pages on the site. I configured it by specifying user-agent:* which means all web robots and then I specifying the page which I need to be not accessed Disallow:/contact. </p>

        <h2>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h2>

        <p>It is for integrating webpages into the social graph. It displays the links in a better way rather than displying only the link    as a line. I added image, title, url, title and description tags to my webpages.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h2>

        <p>It helps to make webpages look consistent and independent from its code so we can change and edit the design in easier and faster. More over it is useful to avoid code duplication. If two elements share the same style we do not need to write the style more than one time in a seperate file. </p>
